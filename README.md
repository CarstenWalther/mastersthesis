# Data-Driven Ordering and Dynamic Pricing Competition on Online Marketplaces
## Master's Thesis by Carsten Walther
### Abstract
Online marketplaces become increasingly competitive. Merchants frequently and
automatically adjust offer prices to get an advantage over the competition. At
the same time, merchants have to estimate demand to prevent understocking
and overstocking. Finding optimal pricing and ordering strategies is challenging
because demand is uncertain, sales are affected by competitors’ prices, and
pricing and ordering decisions are mutually dependent. Merchants’ pricing and
ordering decisions determine their profitability and economic viability.
We utilize dynamic programming to derive optimized pricing and ordering policies
with the objective to maximize long-term profit. Demand is estimated based on
historical market data using demand learning. Furthermore, we implemented
a merchant that uses the proposed optimization approach. The merchant was
tested and evaluated on the Price Wars platform. We compared performance of
merchant strategies in duopoly and oligopoly simulations. As soon as a sufficient
amount of sales observations is available, our merchant outperforms traditional
rule-based merchants.
