\chapter{Problem Description}
This thesis investigates the combined problems of dynamic pricing and inventory control on an online marketplace under competition.
%some more intro here
Merchants can order products from a producer with unlimited supply. 
Merchants can see competitor offers but get no information about sales except their own.
Merchants can request the current market situation and update prices with a limited rate.
Prices can be changed over time but cannot be adjusted to different customers.
Merchants sell a single product type, but solutions for this problem are easy to extend to multiple products with independent demand.
There are no back orders. If a merchant runs out of stock, it might miss on sales.

%cost definition
The merchants' costs consists of fixed and variable order costs and inventory holding costs.
Fixed order costs are comparable to shipping fees and are the same per order, independent from the order size.
Variable order costs consist of the cost per ordered item.
Merchants pay holding costs for storing products in their inventory.
The longer an item remains in the inventory, the higher is its holding cost. 
The only source of income for a merchant are sales on the marketplace.

The merchants' inventories have no capacity limit.
However, sensible order strategies only use a limited capacity in order save holding costs.

% products don't perish / are durable
% price changes over time, not per customer

% customers:
% behavior unknown for merchant
% random time between visits
% checks all items within random budget, buys random one but cheaper -> higher probability
