%problem + former state
This thesis develops a merchant that runs on the \pricewars platform and is exposed to the inventory and dynamic pricing problem.
The merchant competes against other merchants and makes automatic ordering and pricing decisions.
The platform in its original form did support pricing decisions.
The problem is that the platform did not support ordering decisions.
Merchants could order items from the producer but only one item at a time.
%motivation
This is an unrealistic setting.
Real merchants actually order multiple items at once to prevent high shipping costs.
But this leads to the inventory control problem.
Merchants have to decide at what point in time to order and how many items.
They have to keep customer demand in mind to avoid stock-outs.
This thesis extends the \pricewars platform by the inventory control problem.
This allows to simulate competitions of merchants, that make ordering and pricing decisions.
Different merchant strategies can be evaluated this way.

%new state + describe following structure
We added effects and costs to the platform that will influence merchants' ordering decisions.
These extensions are explained in the following sections.
The last two \cref{section:inventory_graph,section:benchmark_tool} present helpful additions to evaluate merchant performances.

\section{Ordering multiple Items}
\label{section:multiple_items}
First of all, merchants must be able to order multiple items in one order.
Some parts of the platform already supported this use case.
For example, expense and profit calculation for merchants already supported orders of multiple items.
However, there was no option to order more than one item from the producer.
By adding a parameter to the order request \texttt{POST /orders}, merchants can request their desired amount, e.g., \texttt{POST /orders?amount=14}.
Accordingly, the producer returns an order with that many items.
Ordering different product type with one order is not supported.

The option to order multiple items will not affect merchants' strategies.
They can still order a single item whenever they need one.
The next section introduces fixed order cost to discourage this behavior.
