The merchant's task can be separated into the inventory problem and dynamic pricing problem.

%pricing problem
Dynamic pricing is the continuous adjusting of prices.
This is applicable if it is cheap and fast to change prices like in e-commerce or in retail stores with digital price tags. %todo: citation
Dynamic pricing in this thesis is about time discriminating prices and not customer discriminating prices. %todo reformulate and maybe one sentence for explanation
Den Boer~\cite{den2015dynamic} gives an extensive overview over this topic.
Araman and Caldentey propose methods for the dynamic pricing problem with complete and incomplete information about the demand distribution~\cite{araman2011revenue}.

%joint ordering and pricing
The inventory problem and dynamic pricing problem cannot be solved independently from each other because pricing and order decisions influence each other.
%influence not each other; influence expected result
Elmaghraby and Keskinocak review papers that offer solutions for the dynamic pricing problem under inventory considerations~\cite{elmaghraby2003dynamic}.
They separate solutions into three categories:
(Non-)Replenishment of inventory, (non-)dependent demand over time, and myopic versus strategic customers.

\subsubsection*{Ordering Problem}
%known demand
The ordering problem, also called inventory control problem, has been studied for a long time.
An overview about this problem for deterministic and stochastic demand is given by Scarf~\cite{scarf1963survey}.
Harris~\cite{harris1913many} proposed a solution for the ordering problem with constant deterministic demand and Wagner and Within~\cite{wagner1958dynamic} proposed a solution under deterministic, but varying demand.

%unknown demand
If demand is uncertain, future demand must be estimated from past sales.
Some publications investigate specific classes of parameterized demand distributions and propose methods to find parameters, so that the demand distribution fits the experienced sales best~\cite{azoury1985bayes}.
Others propose methods to find ordering policies without assumptions about the underlying demand distribution~\cite{DBLP:journals/mor/LeviRS07,huh2011adaptive,ban2017big}

Besbes and Muharremoglu~\cite{DBLP:journals/mansci/BesbesM13} studied the effect of access to information about missed sales on the necessity to explore inventory decisions.

\subsubsection*{Pricing and Ordering under Competition}
%only pricing
Chen and Chen~\cite{chen2015recent} provide an overview about the dynamic pricing problem under competition for single-product and multi-product scenarios.
Schlosser and Boissier~\cite{Schlosser_2017} proposed a method to find optimal pricing policies if competitor strategies are known.
The dynamic pricing problem under competition with a finite time horizon is studied by~\cite{DBLP:journals/mansci/Martinez-de-AlbenizT11,Schlosser_2018}

%joint pricing & inventory 
Adida and Perakis~\cite{DBLP:journals/ior/AdidaP10} consider joint pricing and inventory control in a duopoly.

\subsubsection*{Platform}
%todo better title
%Serth et al. built an interactive simulation platform, called \pricewars, to test and evaluate merchant strategies on online marketplaces~\cite{DBLP:conf/recsys/0001SPSBLLSU17, edoc2017pricewars}.
%We developed our merchant with the help of this platform.
