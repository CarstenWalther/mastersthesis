%situation
%check: what is oredring strategy?
Merchants use pricing and ordering strategies to compete against each other on online marketplaces.
%problem statement
Finding optimal pricing and ordering strategies is challenging because demand is uncertain, sales are affected by competitors' prices, and pricing and ordering decisions are mutually dependent.
%why is problem important (motivation)
%todo repetition of ordering and pricing
A merchant's pricing and ordering decisions determine profitability and therefore the economic viability.
%startling sentence
%why did we built it?
We built a data-driven merchant that uses dynamic optimization methods to outperform traditional rule-based merchants.
%'this merchant runs on' or 'we tested and evaluated on...'?
% merchant makes joint decisions
This merchant runs on the \pricewars platform, an interactive simulation platform to test and evaluate merchant strategies in competitive e-commerce environments.
%todo make platform extension mmore important
Furthermore, we extended the platform by an ordering process to provide merchants the possibility to make ordering decisions and control their inventory level.
%implication of solution
%my merchant is advanced baseline for comparison of new advanced merchants beside simple rule-based merchants


problem: price (and order) optimization is hard (competition, unknown customer behavior)
why is problem important: profitability
what we done?:
	optimized joint pricing + ordering strategies
	implemented, evaluated on platform
