\begin{itemize}
	\item problem: optimal joint pricing/ordering under competition on online marketplaces
	\item solution: optimization with dynamic programming with estimated sales probabilities from demand learning
	\item finding: policies optimal as long as sales prob prediction is good (-> reduces problem to find good predictions)
	\item finding: update interval (i.e. calculation speed) is key (needs eval)
	\item finding: data-driven > rule-based (if enough data)
	\item application: apply solution on real marketplace e.g. amazon
	\item application: our merchant = baseline/comparison for new/modified pricing+ordering merchants on price wars (we lack comparison to other advanced pricing/ordering merchant)
	\item
	\item future work
	\item extend problem by perishable products or multi-product with dependent demand
	\item consider competition reactions/strategies for optimal policies %anticipate
	\item iterate on demand learning -> able to predict more complex relations
