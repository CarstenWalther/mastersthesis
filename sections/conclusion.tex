%%%%policy optimization
%restate problem, why important:
%what decisions?
Making good decisions on competitive online marketplaces is crucial for the success of a merchant.
%solution
We presented different dynamic optimization models for four problem scenarios, which become increasingly realistic but also more complex.
Pricing and ordering policies are created with a dynamic programming approach.
The uncertain demand is estimated based on historical market data using demand learning with linear regression.
%key findings / main points
We implemented a merchant using these optimization approaches.
Computation time efficiency of the dynamic programming approach was improved until the merchant reacted fast enough  to new market situations.
The merchant was tested on the \pricewars platform against rule-based merchants in different scenarios.
Our merchant is able to outperform the rule-based merchants if enough trainings data is available.
%significance of findings / application
The presented optimization approaches can be applied to real online marketplaces -- such as Amazon -- to potentially increase profits.

%%%%%platform extension
%problem
Formerly, it was not possible to simulate our problem scenarios on the \pricewars platform.
%solution
We extended the platform by orders of multiple items, fixed order costs, holding costs, and order delivery delay.
%impact of solution
These extensions allow testing and evaluating merchant strategies under more realistic conditions.
Moreover, our merchant implementation can be used as a baseline to compare new ordering and pricing strategies.

%%%%%future work
There are three lines of work arising from this thesis.
The dynamic pricing and inventory control problem can be extended to consider perishable products or multiple products with interdependent demand.
%make this sentence better
Both problems require changes to the dynamic programming approach and the problem with multiple products with interdependent demand requires changes to the demand learning component.
The price and order optimization could anticipate competitors' reactions.
This can result in different policies compared to optimizations that do not consider competitors' reactions.
Lastly, customer demand could depend on more dimensions than the price, like product quality or merchant rating.
This requires new explanatory variables for market situations and maybe a more complex demand learning model.

%market more dynamic -> be dynamic to compete -> better strat decides)

%so what?
%why should anyone care?

%finding: update interval (i.e. calculation speed) is key (needs eval)
%finding: policies optimal as long as sales prob prediction is good (-> reduces problem to find good predictions)
