%merchants want to automate pricing
Pricing decisions on online marketplaces become increasingly automated.
Merchants expect higher profits if they can adapt their prices faster to competitors' offers.
The optimal price depends not only on competitors' prices but also on the supply.
A merchant with a filled inventory might want to set a different price than with a nearly empty inventory.

%ordering
Another common decision for a merchant is the order decision.
When and how many items should it order?
% better word for balance?
% first introduce order cost & holding cost?
The merchant wants to find a good balance between few big orders, which minimizes fixed order costs, and many small orders, which minimizes holding cots.
Ordering and pricing influence each other and should be decided jointly.

This thesis develops a merchant that makes these ordering and pricing decisions with the goal to maximize its profit.
This merchant runs on the \pricewars platform, which is a online marketplace simulation.
It was created to develop and test merchant strategies.
Part of this thesis is to extend the platform by an order concept and allow merchants to make order decisions.
This extension leads to more realistic marketplace simulations.

This thesis' merchant uses demand learning on data of previous sales to predict customer demand.
Pricing and ordering policies are created based on the predicted demand.
