\chapter{Introduction}
%Why dynamic pricing?
Price updates on today's online markets increase in number and happen in shorter intervals.
Merchants get an advantage by adjusting their prices to competitors' prices.
The frequent updating of prices is called dynamic pricing and is used by merchants to increase their profit compared to traditional pricing strategies.
Online marketplaces are ideal environments for dynamic pricing strategies because there are almost no costs for price changes.
Human agents lack the fast response times and endurance to compete with software agents.
Additionally, these programs are able to analyze huge amounts of historical market data and can estimate customer buying behavior from it.

%Why inventory control?
Another important task of a merchant is keeping track of the inventory.
If the inventory level is too low, the merchant might miss potential sales due to a stock-out.
But storing a lot of items causes high holding costs.
This is the inventory control problem or ordering problem and it is about when to order how many items.
It is crucial to accurately predict future demand for good order decisions.

%Joint pricing and inventory
Pricing and inventory decisions influence each other.
The optimal price depends not only on external factors like competitors' prices but also on the available inventory.
When inventory is low, it could be a good decision to increase the price in order to reduce the demand.
If the merchant reduces prices, the demand will increase, which must be considered in the order decision.
Because of this mutual influence, ordering and pricing should be decided jointly.

%platform + contributions
%todo contributions as compact list?
%joint ordering/pricing repetition
We developed a merchant that makes joint ordering and pricing decisions using dynamic programming with the goal to maximize its profit.
The merchant uses demand learning to estimate future demand based on data of previous sales.
This merchant runs on the \pricewars platform, an open framework to simulate dynamic pricing competition on online marketplaces.
% word 'settings' is ambiguous
The platform was created to test how merchant strategies perform in realistic settings.
This thesis extends the platform by the inventory control problem.
% formulate more positive 'force'
This forces merchants to control their inventory level and make order decisions.
This extension makes more realistic marketplace simulations possible.
